# Time-Series-EDA

# Step 1: Data Gathering:
the time series data has been downloaded by using python library called Pandas-DataReader. this library lets you access financial and economic data.

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# a) Time Resampling: 
This allows you to do change the frequency of the datetime column such as changing it from daily to weekly or to monthly and then apply an aggregation function. that why we can calculate figures for over a certain period of time.

# b) Rolling: it allows you to apply aggregation over a window which rolls over data records.
